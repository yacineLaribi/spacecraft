                    <h2>The Objective of Thesis Work</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">The control system plays an important role in spacecraft missions by keeping the body in its intended orbit and attitude.
                         Both control elements and control algorithms are developed by control engineers for control missions.
                         Early spacecraft attitude control was based on the assumption that the body was rigid. However, the new communications 
                         satellites are tricky from a control point of view because their designs have several sources of flexibility: solar panels, 
                         antennas that can be very large relative to the main body, which can cause degradation in the performance of the attitude control system.
                          The first active attitude control was designed and implemented by PID/PD controllers where it could stabilize the system. 
                          For flexible dynamics, the task is more delicate, since the previous controller will not be able to get satisfactory results. <br> <br>
                        In this interface, a composite controller design approach is proposed for flexible spacecraft based on the disturbance 
                        observer based control and several controllers which are: PD, SMC, and ASMC controllers.
                          Simulation for flexible spacecraft is done with Matlab /Simulink platform.
